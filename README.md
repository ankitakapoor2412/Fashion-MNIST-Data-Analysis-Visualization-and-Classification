# Fashion-MNIST-Data-Analysis-Visualization-and-Classification

This repository contains feature extraction methods to process image data and used classic data analysis and machine learning algorithms that includes Random Forest, SVM, K-Nearsest Neighbors and also some Ensembling methods like Voting and Stacking for classification.
It also contains Deep Learning Methods used for classification such as CNN, Autoencoder and some pre-trained Machine Learning models such as Xception Net and VGG16 which are available in Keras API.
Compared the results of the methods used.
